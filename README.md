# EdgeMath-AI-offline-llm-

## Overview

**EdgeMath AI** is a locally hosted AI model designed to solve algebraic equations offline on a Raspberry Pi 4. Utilizing edge computing, it processes math problems in real-time without internet access, making it ideal for resource-constrained environments. This lightweight math solver supports algebra, geometry (area and volume), and linear equations with 2-3 variables, tailored to the Class 10th math syllabus.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Hardware**:  
  - Raspberry Pi 4 (4GB or 8GB RAM recommended)  
  - MicroSD card (32GB+ recommended)  
  - Power supply (5V, 3A)  
- **Software**:  
  - Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit)  
  - Python 3.11+  
  - Llama.cpp (optimized inference engine)  
  - Phi-2.Q4_K_M.gguf (lightweight LLM model)  
  - Python Libraries: `llama-cpp-python`, `numpy`, `sympy`, `uvicorn`  

## System Architecture

EdgeMath AI leverages a quantized LLM (Phi-2) optimized with Llama.cpp:
1. **Model Loading**: Loads `phi-2.Q4_K_M.gguf` into memory on Raspberry Pi.
2. **Input Processing**: Parses user math queries via a terminal interface.
3. **Inference**: Uses Llama.cpp to solve equations step-by-step.
4. **Output**: Displays solutions with intermediate steps in the terminal.


## System Requirements

- **Hardware**: Raspberry Pi 4 (4GB or 8GB), MicroSD card (32GB+), 5V/3A power supply  
- **Software**: Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit), Python 3.11+, Llama.cpp, Phi-2.Q4_K_M.gguf
